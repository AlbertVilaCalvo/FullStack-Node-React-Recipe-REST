## Features

- Authentication: register, login, validate email, recover password.
- Settings: change the user's name, email and password. Delete the user account.
- Recipe: publish, edit and delete recipes.

## Local development

The application is available at:

- Web (React): http://localhost:3000
- Server (API): http://localhost:5000
- Database: localhost:5432

To run the app locally, do:

```shell
cp .env.local .env
# (Optional) Edit .env to adjust values

# Start all services
docker compose up --build

# (Optional) Seed the database with users and recipes
./scripts/local-development/seed-database.sh

# View service status
docker compose ps

# Stop everything, but keep the database data
docker compose down
# Stop everything and discard the database data
docker compose down --volumes
```

To run only a single service locally do:

```shell
cd server # Or cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Local database

The local PostgreSQL database is created automatically when you run `docker compose up --build`. You can interact with it from within the Docker container.

```shell
# Connect to database from within the Docker container
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d recipemanager

# Backup database
docker compose exec db pg_dump -U postgres recipemanager > backup.sql

# Restore database
docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d recipemanager < backup.sql
```

The database port is exposed to `localhost:5432` on the host machine. This allows you to connect to the database using a client from your machine.

```shell
# Connect to database from your host machine
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d recipemanager
```

You will be prompted for the password, which is defined in your `.env` file.

### Seed the local database

Once the local database container is running, you can automatically fill it with users and recipes using the provided script:

```shell
./scripts/local-development/seed-database.sh
```

This script will:

1. Create two test users.
2. Seed the database with sample recipe data.

Alternatively, you can run similar steps manually:

- `curl http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Albert", "email":"a@a.com", "password":"123456"}'`
- `curl http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Blanca", "email":"b@b.com", "password":"123456"}'`
- `docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d recipemanager < server/database-seed.sql`

## Database

Database schema changes are managed using [node-pg-migrate](https://github.com/salsita/node-pg-migrate).
Migrations run automatically when the server starts.
Migrations are stored in `server/migrations/` as SQL files.

### Creating a new migration

```shell
cd server
npm run migrate:create -- my-migration-name
```

This creates a new SQL file in `server/migrations/` with a timestamp prefix. Edit the file to add your schema changes:

```sql
-- Up Migration
ALTER TABLE recipe ADD COLUMN description TEXT;

---- Down Migration
ALTER TABLE recipe DROP COLUMN description;
```

### Running migrations manually

Migrations run automatically on server startup, but you can also run them manually:

```shell
cd server

# Run the next pending migration
npm run migrate:up

# Rollback the last migration
npm run migrate:down
```

## Email account setup

Sending emails requires creating an account at https://ethereal.email. Click the 'Create Ethereal Account' button and copy-paste the user and password to the `.env` file environment variables `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD`.

You can view the emails at https://ethereal.email/messages. URLs to view each email sent are also logged at the server console.

## Git pre-commit hook

To check formatting and validate code on every commit, set up the Git pre-commit hook:

```shell
cp pre-commit .git/hooks
```

Note that the checks do not abort the commit (it's very annoying), they only inform you of any issues found. It's your responsibility to fix them and amend the commit.

The checks performed are:

- Prettier for code formatting.
- TypeScript compiler (tsc) for type checking.
- ESLint for linting.
- Terraform fmt and validate.
- ShellCheck for shell scripts.

## Deploy infrastructure with Terraform

### Web (Frontend)

To deploy the React frontend to S3 and CloudFront:

```shell
cd terraform/web/environments/dev # Or prod
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your values if needed
terraform init
terraform plan -out tfplan
terraform apply tfplan
```

### Server (API)

#### 1. Create AWS Infrastructure

Create the AWS infrastructure (VPC, EKS, RDS, ECR, etc.):

```shell
./scripts/server/create-aws-infrastructure.sh dev  # Or prod
```

Edit the `terraform/server/environments/dev/terraform.tfvars` or `prod/terraform.tfvars` file to adjust values to your desire before running the script.

This script will:

- Initialize Terraform
- Create VPC, EKS cluster, RDS database, ECR repository, Pod Identity, ACM certificate for the API endpoint and application secrets (JWT, email credentials)
- Install Load Balancer Controller and Karpenter
- Create Karpenter NodePool and EC2NodeClass
- Display next steps

This process takes approximately 20-30 minutes.

#### 2. Build and Push Docker Image

After the AWS infrastructure is created, build and push the Docker image to ECR:

```shell
./scripts/server/build-push-image-ecr.sh dev  # Or prod
```

This script will:

- Build the Docker image with a timestamp-based tag
- Log in to ECR and push the image
- Output the IMAGE_TAG to use for deployment

#### 3. Deploy Server Application to EKS

Deploy the server application to the EKS cluster:

```shell
./scripts/server/deploy-server-eks.sh dev <image_tag>  # Use the IMAGE_TAG from build-push-image-ecr.sh output
```

For example:

```shell
./scripts/server/deploy-server-eks.sh dev 2026-01-15-12h00m00s
```

This script will:

- Configure kubectl to connect to the EKS cluster
- Fetch configuration from Terraform outputs, terraform.tfvars file, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.
- Process Kubernetes manifests using Kustomize and replace placeholders
- Apply the manifests to deploy the server to EKS and wait for the deployment to complete

#### 4. Create Route53 A Record

After deploying the application, create the Route53 A record for the API endpoint:

```shell
cd terraform/server/environments/dev  # Or prod
terraform apply -target=module.api_endpoint_dns_record
```

This creates a Route53 A record (api.recipemanager.link) pointing to the Application Load Balancer created by the Ingress. The ACM certificate was already created and validated during infrastructure setup in step 1.

#### 5. Delete AWS Infrastructure

To delete all AWS infrastructure:

```shell
./scripts/server/delete-aws-infrastructure.sh dev  # Or prod
```

This script will:

- Prompt for confirmation
- Delete Kubernetes resources
- Delete AWS infrastructure (VPC, EKS, RDS, ECR, etc.) in the correct order

**Warning:** This will permanently delete all infrastructure resources, including the ECR images!

## Automatic deployment with GitHub Actions

Once the AWS infrastructure is deployed, you can set up automatic deployment of the React web app to S3 and CloudFront using GitHub Actions.

At the GitHub repository, go to Settings → Environments and create an environment named "dev" or "prod".
On that page, click the environment and add the following environment variables (not secrets):

| Environment variable               | Value                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `AWS_REGION`                       | `us-east-1`                                           |
| `AWS_GITHUB_ACTIONS_OIDC_ROLE_ARN` | `terraform output oidc_role_arn`                      |
| `WEB_S3_BUCKET`                    | `terraform output website_s3_bucket_name`             |
| `WEB_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`   | `terraform output website_cloudfront_distribution_id` |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL`                | `https://api.recipemanager.link/api`                  |

## Manually deploy the React web app to AWS S3 and CloudFront

This is done automatically using GitHub Actions (see [Automatic deployment with GitHub Actions](#automatic-deployment-with-github-actions)), but you can also do it manually:

```shell
cd web
npm run build
aws s3 sync build s3://<s3-bucket-name> --delete
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id <distribution-id> --paths '/*'
```
