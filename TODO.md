## Authentication

- [x] Change email
- [x] Change password
- [x] Delete account
- [x] Send welcome email after registering, alert email after login etc
  - https://medium.com/@SigniorGratiano/express-authentication-and-security-dac99e6b33c
  - https://github.com/platzi/curso-nodejs-auth/blob/13-step/nodemailer.js
- [x] Verify email after registering
  - https://www.simplecode.io/blog/create-a-rest-api-part-4-send-emails-with-amazon-ses/
  - https://www.simplecode.io/blog/create-a-rest-api-part-5-verify-users-with-tokens/
- [x] Forgot/recover/reset password
  - https://medium.com/@SigniorGratiano/express-authentication-and-security-dac99e6b33c
  - https://github.com/platzi/curso-nodejs-auth/blob/13-step/services/auth.service.js#L37-L54
  - https://www.simplecode.io/blog/create-a-rest-api-part-7-forgot-reset-password-routes/
  - Adds CSRF token at the view new-password.ejs https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Node.js-The-Complete-Guide/tree/main/S17 - https://www.packtpub.com/product/node-js-the-complete-guide/9781838826864
  - Reset password token saved to database: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Node.js-API-Masterclass-with-Express-and-MongoDB/blob/3129725fa9582011f1e9db3b94e1dda2aafa9f0f/models/User.js#L62 - https://www.packtpub.com/product/node-js-api-masterclass-with-express-and-mongodb/9781800569638
- [ ] If email is not verified, restrict what you can do (eg do not allow to publish recipes)
  - Can be easily done with a middleware that runs after AuthMiddleware.requireLoggedUser, checking `email_verified`
  - We have to show a pop-up to the user after registering, see:
  - https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/109958/best-way-to-handle-new-user-registration-when-email-verification-is-required
  - https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/29145/limiting-access-before-email-address-is-confirmed
  - https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/12367/when-to-explain-email-verification-process-to-the-user
- [ ] When the user changes the email, verify it before overriding the old one. We'll need to store the 2 emails (old and new) temporarily
  - Changing an e-mail sends a verification mail to the user's mailbox, and only after verification - the new email overwrites the old one. [source](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/12367/when-to-explain-email-verification-process-to-the-user)
  - What is the suggested best practice for changing a user's email address? - https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/234060/what-is-the-suggested-best-practice-for-changing-a-users-email-address
- [ ] After changing the email, send an informative email to the previous account explaining that someone has changed the email
  - https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/85494 See point 2: "Sends a notification E-mail to the old address"
- [ ] Similarly, after changing the password, also send an alert email?

## Authentication session

- [ ] Replace JWT with opaque token or session id saved in cookie + session store (Redis/Postgres)
  - JWT blacklist: https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices/blob/master/sections/security/expirejwt.md

- [ ] On logout, expire session at the server. Requires having a session store and adding a new route /logout
- [ ] If the session expires, do a logout on the client?
- [ ] Changing the password or resetting the password should invalidate all existing sessions of that user? See https://medium.com/@SigniorGratiano/express-authentication-and-security-dac99e6b33c as an example
- [ ] Once we have a session store, at the Settings page, show a list of the active sessions like in https://github.com/settings/security

## Front

- [ ] Add an error boundary

- [ ] UI tests
- [ ] Footer add my name and link to source code
- [ ] Check navigation with keyboard at forms
- [ ] Why did you render: https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render
  - Setup requires many extra steps for Create React App :/
